> A Chrome extension that lets you do only one thing. i.e. To jot down one thing on the new tab without any distractions and show it big and loud everytime you open a new tab. So that you don't miss it at all!

That's it! That's the "Sole" purpose of this extension.

You can jot down your most important *reminder*, *an idea*, *a phone number*, *an inspirational quote*, and so on.

Of course, Sole also supports [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). So, you can also jot down things in your favorite markup language easily.
